# UseEffect

## Hooks, Context API

The aim of this project is to practice using useEffect hook. I use it to display a list of users which gives detailed info about a user you click on.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### In order to check the project, you can run

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
